@article{Millea2017,
abstract = {We develop the first algorithm able to jointly compute the maximum a posteriori estimate of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization fields, the gravitational potential by which they are lensed, and cosmological parameters such as the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. This is an important step towards sampling from the joint posterior probability function of these quantities, which, assuming Gaussianity of the CMB fields and lensing potential, contains all available cosmological information and would yield theoretically optimal constraints. Attaining such optimal constraints will be crucial for next-generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4, where limits on r could be improved by factors of a few over currently used sub-optimal quadratic estimators. The maximization procedure described here depends on a newly developed lensing algorithm, which we term LenseFlow, and which lenses a map by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. This description has conceptual advantages, such as allowing us to give a simple non-perturbative proof that the lensing determinant is equal to unity in the weak-lensing regime. The algorithm itself maintains this property even on pixelized maps, which is crucial for our purposes and unique to LenseFlow as compared to other lensing algorithms we have tested. It also has other useful properties such as that it can be trivially inverted (i.e. delensing) for the same computational cost as the forward operation, and can be used to compute lensing adjoint, Jacobian, and Hessian operators. We test and validate the maximization procedure on flat-sky simulations covering up to 600 deg 2 with non-uniform noise and masking.},

abstract = {Inflation predicts a primordial gravitational wave spectrum that is slightly “red.” In this Brief Report, we compute both the amplitude and spectral form of the primordial tensor spectrum predicted by cyclic or ekpyrotic models under the assumption that perturbations pass smoothly through the bounce. The spectrum is exponentially suppressed compared to inflation on long wavelengths. The strongest constraint is that the energy density in gravitational waves is less than 10% of the critical density at nucleosynthesis.},

abstract = {This paper details a description of the pattern of galaxy image distortion over the entire sky caused by the gravitational lensing which is the result of large scale inhomogeneities in our universe. We present a tensor spherical harmonic formalism to describe this pattern, giving many useful formulae. This is applied to density inhomogeneities, where we compute the angular power spectrum of the shear pattern, as well as the noise properties due to finite galaxy sampling and cosmic variance. We show that a detectable level of shear is present for very nearby galaxies, $z\simlt0.2$. For such a shallow sample much of the largest signal-to-noise comes from very large angular scales, $\theta\simgt10^\circ$, although it is in the form of very small shear at a level $\simlt10^{-3}$.},

abstract = {We present data on the polarization of the thermal emission from Galactic Clouds at 60 mum, 100 mum, and 350 mum. There are examples of rising polarization spectra in dense cloud cores [P(350 mum/P(100 $\mu$m)\$\sim$2], and falling spectra in cloud envelopes [P(350)/P(100 $\mu$m)\$\sim$0.6]. We also present data showing that the relationship, P(tau), between polarization and optical depth in cloud cores is different from that in cloud envelopes. We review the principles governing the far-infrared polarization spectrum and discuss applications to the data on P(lambda) and P(tau). We conclude that the cloud envelopes we have observed must contain two populations of grains that differ in their polarization efficiencies and in their emission spectra. We propose a model for cloud envelopes in which the contrasting populations reside in domains of different mean temperatures where the warmer domains contain the aligned grains.},

abstract = {We present the first determination of the Galactic polarized emission at 353 GHz by Archeops. The data were taken during the Arctic night of February 7, 2002 after the balloon-borne instrument was launched by CNES from the Swedish Esrange base near Kiruna. In addition to the 143 GHz and 217 GHz frequency bands dedicated to CMB studies, Archeops had one 545 GHz and six 353 GHz bolometers mounted in three polarization-sensitive pairs that were used for Galactic foreground studies. We present maps of the I, Q, U Stokes parameters over 17% of the sky and with a 13 arcmin resolution at 353 GHz (850 $\mu$m). They show a significant Galactic large scale polarized emission coherent on the longitude ranges [100, 120] and [180, 200] deg. with a degree of polarization at the level of 4-5%, in agreement with expectations from starlight polarization measurements. Some regions in the Galactic plane (Gem OB1, Cassiopeia) show an even stronger degree of polarization in the range 10-20%. These findings provide strong evidence for a powerful grain alignment mechanism throughout the interstellar medium and a coherent magnetic field coplanar to the Galactic plane. This magnetic field pervades even some dense clouds. Extrapolated to high Galactic latitude, these results indicate that interstellar dust polarized emission is the major foreground for PLANCK-HFI CMB polarization measurements.},

abstract = {We present a demonstration of delensing the observed cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization anisotropy. This process of reducing the gravitational-lensing generated B-mode component will become increasingly important for improving searches for the B modes produced by primordial gravitational waves. In this work, we delens B-mode maps constructed from multi-frequency SPTpol observations of a 90 deg$^2$ patch of sky by subtracting a B-mode template constructed from two inputs: SPTpol E-mode maps and a lensing potential map estimated from the $\textit{Herschel}$ $500\,\mu m$ map of the CIB. We find that our delensing procedure reduces the measured B-mode power spectrum by 28% in the multipole range $300 < \ell < 2300$; this is shown to be consistent with expectations from theory and simulations and to be robust against systematics. The null hypothesis of no delensing is rejected at $6.9 \sigma$. Furthermore, we build and use a suite of realistic simulations to study the general properties of the delensing process and find that the delensing efficiency achieved in this work is limited primarily by the noise in the lensing potential map. We demonstrate the importance of including realistic experimental non-idealities in the delensing forecasts used to inform instrument and survey-strategy planning of upcoming lower-noise experiments, such as CMB-S4.},

@article{Flauger2014,
abstract = {BICEP2 has reported the detection of a degree-scale B-mode polarization pattern in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and has interpreted the measurement as evidence for primordial gravitational waves. Motivated by the profound importance of the discovery of gravitational waves from the early Universe, we examine to what extent a combination of Galactic foregrounds and lensed E-modes could be responsible for the signal. We reanalyze the BICEP2 results and show that the 100x150 GHz and 150x150 GHz data are consistent with a cosmology with r=0.2 and negligible foregrounds, but also with a cosmology with r=0 and a significant dust polarization signal. We give independent estimates of the dust polarization signal in the BICEP2 region using four different approaches. While these approaches are consistent with each other, the expected amplitude of the dust polarization power spectrum remains uncertain by about a factor of three. The lower end of the prediction leaves room for a primordial contribution, but at the higher end the dust in combination with the standard CMB lensing signal could account for the BICEP2 observations, without requiring the existence of primordial gravitational waves. By measuring the cross-correlations between the pre-Planck templates used in the BICEP2 analysis and between different versions of a data-based template, we emphasize that cross-correlations between models are very sensitive to noise in the polarization angles and that measured cross-correlations are likely underestimates of the contribution of foregrounds to the map. These results suggest that BICEP1 and BICEP2 data alone cannot distinguish between foregrounds and a primordial gravitational wave signal, and that future Keck Array observations at 100 GHz and Planck observations at higher frequencies will be crucial to determine whether the signal is of primordial origin.

abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega_m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n_s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N_ eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to < 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega_K| < 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r <0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r < 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

abstract = {The cosmic infrared background records much of the radiant energy released by processes of structure formation that have occurred since the decoupling of matter and radiation following the Big Bang. In the past few years, data from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) mission provided the first measurements of this background, with additional constraints coming from studies of the attenuation of TeV gamma-rays. At the same time, there has been rapid progress in resolving a significant fraction of this background with the deep galaxy counts at infrared wavelengths from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) instruments and at submillimeter wavelengths from the Submillimeter Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) instrument. This article reviews the measurements of the infrared background and sources contributing to it and discusses the implications for past and present cosmic processes.},

abstract = {Gravity waves (GWs) in the early Universe generate B-type polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which can be used as a direct way to measure the energy scale of inflation. Gravitational lensing contaminates the GW signal by converting the dominant E polarization into B polarization. By reconstructing the lensing potential from the CMB itself one can decontaminate the B mode induced by lensing. We present results of numerical simulations of B mode delensing using quadratic and iterative maximum-likelihood lensing reconstruction methods as a function of detector noise and beam. In our simulations we find that the quadratic method can reduce the lensing B noise power by up to a factor of 7, close to the no noise limit. In contrast, the iterative method shows significant improvements even at the lowest noise levels we tested. We demonstrate explicitly that with this method at least a factor of 40 noise power reduction in lensing induced B power is possible, suggesting that r=Ph/PR˜10-6 may be achievable in the absence of sky cuts, foregrounds, and instrumental systematics. While we do not find any fundamental lower limit due to lensing, we find that for high-sensitivity detectors residual lensing noise dominates over the detector noise.},

@article{Namikawa2015,
abstract = {The B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background on large scales has been considered as a probe of gravitational waves from the cosmic inflation. Ongoing and future experiments will, however, suffer from contamination due to the B-modes of non-primordial origins, one of which is the lensing induced B-mode polarization. Subtraction of the lensing B-modes, usually referred to as delensing, will be required for further improvement of detection sensitivity of the gravitational waves. In such experiments, knowledge of statistical properties of the B-modes after delensing is indispensable to likelihood analysis particularly because the lensing B-modes are known to be non-Gaussian. In this paper, we study non-Gaussian structure of the delensed B-modes on large scales, comparing them with those of the lensing B-modes. In particular, we investigate the power spectrum correlation matrix and the probability distribution function (PDF) of the power spectrum amplitude. Assuming an experiment in which the quadratic delensing is an almost optimal method, we find that delensing reduces correlations of the lensing B-mode power spectra between different multipoles, and that the PDF of the power spectrum amplitude is well described as a normal distribution function with a variance larger than that in the case of a Gaussian field. These features are well captured by an analytic model based on the 4th order Edgeworth expansion. As a consequence of the non-Gaussianity, the constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio after delensing is degraded within approximately a few percent, which depends on the multipole range included in the analysis.},

abstract = {We present new, tight, constraints on the cosmological background of gravitational waves (GWs) using the latest measurements of CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies provided by the Planck, BICEP2 and Keck Array experiments. These constraints are further improved when the GW contribution $N^{\rm GW}_{\rm eff}$ to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$ is also considered. Parametrizing the tensor spectrum as a power law with tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, tilt $n_\mathrm{t}$ and pivot $0.01\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and assuming a minimum value of $r=0.001$, we find $r < 0.089$, $n_\mathrm{t} = 1.7^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ ($95\%\,\mathrm{CL}$, no $N^{\rm GW}_{\rm eff}$) and $r < 0.082$, $n_\mathrm{t} = -0.05^{+0.58}_{-0.87}$ ($95\%\,\mathrm{CL}$, with $N^{\rm GW}_{\rm eff}$). When the recently released $95\,\mathrm{GHz}$ data from Keck Array are added to the analysis, the constraints on $r$ are improved to $r < 0.067$ ($95\%\,\mathrm{CL}$, no $N^{\rm GW}_{\rm eff}$), $r < 0.061$ ($95\%\,\mathrm{CL}$, with $N^{\rm GW}_{\rm eff}$). We discuss the limits coming from direct detection experiments such as LIGO-Virgo, pulsar timing (European Pulsar Timing Array) and CMB spectral distortions (FIRAS). Finally, we show future constraints achievable from a COrE-like mission: if the tensor-to-scalar ratio is of order $10^{-2}$ and the inflationary consistency relation $n_\mathrm{t} = -r/8$ holds, COrE will be able to constrain $n_\mathrm{t}$ with an error of $0.16$ at $95\%\,\mathrm{CL}$. In the case that lensing $B$-modes can be subtracted to $10\%$ of their power, a feasible goal for COrE, these limits will be improved to $0.11$ at $95\%\,\mathrm{CL}$.},

abstract = {Based on concepts drawn from the ekpyrotic scenario and M theory, we elaborate our recent proposal of a cyclic model of the universe. In this model, the universe undergoes an endless sequence of cosmic epochs which begin with the universe expanding from a ``big bang'' and end with the universe contracting to a ``big crunch.'' Matching from ``big crunch'' to ``big bang'' is performed according to the prescription recently proposed with Khoury, Ovrut and Seiberg. The expansion part of the cycle includes a period of radiation and matter domination followed by an extended period of cosmic acceleration at low energies. The cosmic acceleration is crucial in establishing the flat and vacuous initial conditions required for ekpyrosis and for removing the entropy, black holes, and other debris produced in the preceding cycle. By restoring the universe to the same vacuum state before each big crunch, the acceleration ensures that the cycle can repeat and that the cyclic solution is an attractor.},

Temperature maps are analyzed by expanding over the set of spherical harmonics to give multipole moments of the two-point correlation function. Polarization, which is described by a second-rank tensor, can be treated analogously by expanding in the appropriate tensor spherical harmonics. We provide expressions for the complete set of temperature and polarization multipole moments for scalar and tensor metric perturbations. Four sets of multipole moments completely describe isotropic temperature and polarization correlations; for scalar metric perturbations one set is identically zero, giving the possibility of a clean determination of the vector and tensor contributions. The variance with which the multipole moments can be measured in idealized experiments is evaluated, including the effects of detector noise, sky coverage, and beam width. Finally, we construct coordinate-independent polarization two-point correlation functions, express them in terms of the multipole moments, and derive small-angle limits.},

abstract = {We present the most significant measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing potential to date (at a level of 40 sigma), using temperature and polarization data from the Planck 2015 full-mission release. Using a polarization-only estimator we detect lensing at a significance of 5 sigma. We cross-check the accuracy of our measurement using the wide frequency coverage and complementarity of the temperature and polarization measurements. Public products based on this measurement include an estimate of the lensing potential over approximately 70% of the sky, an estimate of the lensing potential power spectrum in bandpowers for the multipole range 40<L<400 and an associated likelihood for cosmological parameter constraints. We find good agreement between our measurement of the lensing potential power spectrum and that found in the best-fitting LCDM model based on the Planck temperature and polarization power spectra. Using the lensing likelihood alone we obtain a percent-level measurement of the parameter combination $\sigma_8 \Omega_m^{0.25} = 0.591\pm 0.021$. We combine our determination of the lensing potential with the E-mode polarization also measured by Planck to generate an estimate of the lensing B-mode. We show that this lensing B-mode estimate is correlated with the B-modes observed directly by Planck at the expected level and with a statistical significance of 10 sigma, confirming Planck's sensitivity to this known sky signal. We also correlate our lensing potential estimate with the large-scale temperature anisotropies, detecting a cross-correlation at the 3 sigma level, as expected due to dark energy in the concordance LCDM model.},

abstract = {The reconstruction of the CMB lensing potential is based on a Taylor expansion of lensing effects which is known to have poor convergence properties. For lensing of temperature fluctuations, an understanding of the higher order terms in this expansion which is accurate enough for current experimental sensitivity levels has been developed in Hanson et. al. (2010), as well as a slightly modified Okamoto and Hu quadratic estimator which incorporates lensed rather than unlensed spectra into the estimator weights to mitigate the effect of higher order terms. We extend these results in several ways: (1) We generalize this analysis to the full set of quadratic temperature/polarization lensing estimators, (2) We study the effect of higher order terms for more futuristic experimental noise levels, (3) We show that the ability of the modified quadratic estimator to mitigate the effect of higher order terms relies on a delicate cancellation which occurs only when the true lensed spectra are known. We investigate the sensitivity of this cancellation to uncertainties in or knowledge of these spectra. We find that higher order terms in the Taylor expansion can impact projected error bars at experimental sensitivities similar to those found in future ACTpol/SPTpol experiments.},

abstract = {We present a first internal delensing of CMB maps, both in temperature and polarization, using the public foreground-cleaned (SMICA) Planck 2015 maps. After forming quadratic estimates of the lensing potential, we use the corresponding displacement field to undo the lensing on the same data. We build differences of the delensed spectra to the original data spectra specifically to look for delensing signatures. After taking into account reconstruction noise biases in the delensed spectra, we find an expected sharpening of the power spectrum acoustic peaks with a delensing efficiency of 29\,\% ($TT$) 25\,\% ($TE$) and 22\,\% ($EE$). The detection significance of the delensing effects is very high in all spectra: $12\,\sigma$ in $EE$ polarization; $18\,\sigma$ in $TE$; and $20\,\sigma$ in $TT$. The null hypothesis of no lensing in the maps is rejected at $26\,\sigma$. While direct detection of the power in lensing $B$-modes themselves is not possible at high significance at Planck noise levels, we do detect (at $4.5\,\sigma$) delensing effects in the $B$-mode map, with $7\,\%$ reduction in lensing power. Our results provide a first demonstration of polarization delensing, and generally of internal CMB delensing, and stand in agreement with the baseline $\Lambda$CDM Planck 2015 cosmology expectations.},

We discuss the B modes induced by gravitational lensing and by Galactic foregrounds and show how both are distinguished from those induced by inflationary gravitational waves.

The scenario relies, instead, on physical phenomena that arise naturally in theories based on extra dimensions and branes.

abstract = {We present a method to delens the acoustic peaks of the CMB temperature and polarization power spectra internally, using lensing maps reconstructed from the CMB itself. We find that when delensing CMB acoustic peaks with a lensing potential map derived from the same CMB sky, a large bias arises in the delensed power spectrum. The cause of this bias is that the noise in the reconstructed potential map is derived from, and hence correlated with, the CMB map when delensing. This bias is more significant relative to the signal than an analogous bias found when delensing CMB B modes. We calculate the leading term of this bias, which is present even in the absence of lensing. We also demonstrate one method to remove this bias, using reconstructions from CMB angular scales within given ranges to delens CMB scales outside of those ranges. Some details relevant for a realistic analysis are also discussed, such as the importance of removing mask-induced effects for successful delensing, and a useful null test, obtained from randomizing the phases of the reconstructed potential. Our findings should help current and next-generation CMB experiments obtain tighter parameter constraints via the internal removal of lensing-induced smoothing from temperature and E-mode acoustic peaks.},

abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega_m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n_s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N_ eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to < 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega_K| < 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r <0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r < 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

abstract = {We consider conditions under which a universe contracting towards a big crunch can make a transition to an expanding big bang universe. A promising example is 11-dimensional M-theory in which the eleventh dimension collapses, bounces, and re-expands. At the bounce, the model can reduce to a weakly coupled heterotic string theory and, we conjecture, it may be possible to follow the transition from contraction to expansion. The possibility opens the door to new classes of cosmological models. For example, we discuss how it suggests a major simplification and modification of the recently proposed ekpyrotic scenario.},

@article{Larsen2016,
abstract = {Delensing is an increasingly important technique to reverse the gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and thus reveal primordial signals the lensing may obscure. We present a first demonstration of delensing on Planck temperature maps using the cosmic infrared background (CIB). Reversing the lensing deflections in Planck CMB temperature maps using a linear combination of the 545 and 857GHz maps as a lensing tracer, we find that the lensing effects in the temperature power spectrum are reduced in a manner consistent with theoretical expectations. In particular, the characteristic sharpening of the acoustic peaks of the temperature power spectrum resulting from successful delensing is detected at a significance of 16$\rm{\sigma}$, with an amplitude of $A_{\rm{delens}} = 1.12 \pm 0.07$ relative to the expected value of unity. This first demonstration on data of CIB delensing, and of delensing techniques in general, is significant because lensing removal will soon be essential for achieving high-precision constraints on inflationary B-mode polarization.},

@article{PlanckCollaborationXI2015,
abstract = {This paper presents the Planck 2015 likelihoods, statistical descriptions of the 2-point correlation functions of CMB temperature and polarization. They use the hybrid approach employed previously: pixel-based at low multipoles, $\ell$, and a Gaussian approximation to the distribution of cross-power spectra at higher $\ell$. The main improvements are the use of more and better processed data and of Planck polarization data, and more detailed foreground and instrumental models. More than doubling the data allows further checks and enhanced immunity to systematics. Progress in foreground modelling enables a larger sky fraction, contributing to enhanced precision. Improvements in processing and instrumental models further reduce uncertainties. Extensive tests establish robustness and accuracy, from temperature, from polarization, and from their combination, and show that the {\Lambda}CDM model continues to offer a very good fit. We further validate the likelihood against specific extensions to this baseline, such as the effective number of neutrino species. For this first detailed analysis of Planck polarization, we concentrate at high $\ell$ on E modes. At low $\ell$ we use temperature at all Planck frequencies along with a subset of polarization. These data take advantage of Planck's wide frequency range to improve the separation of CMB and foregrounds. Within the baseline cosmology this requires a reionization optical depth $\tau=0.078\pm0.019$, significantly lower than without high-frequency data for explicit dust monitoring. At high $\ell$ we detect residual errors in E, typically at the {\mu}K$^2$ level; we thus recommend temperature alone as the high-$\ell$ baseline. Nevertheless, Planck high-$\ell$ polarization spectra are already good enough to allow a separate high-accuracy determination of the {\Lambda}CDM parameters, consistent with those established from temperature alone.},

abstract = {We report the results of a joint analysis of data from BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck. BICEP2 and Keck Array have observed the same approximately 400 deg^{2} patch of sky centered on RA 0 h, Dec. -57.5°. The combined maps reach a depth of 57 nK deg in Stokes Q and U in a band centered at 150 GHz. Planck has observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353 GHz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 $\mu$K deg in Q and U at 143 GHz). We detect 150×353 cross-correlation in B modes at high significance. We fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra at frequencies ≥150 GHz to a lensed-$\Lambda$CDM model that includes dust and a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (as parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio r), using a prior on the frequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous Planck analysis of other regions of the sky. We find strong evidence for dust and no statistically significant evidence for tensor modes. We probe various model variations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component in combination with lower frequency data, and find that these make little difference to the r constraint. Finally, we present an alternative analysis which is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and show that this gives similar constraints. The final result is expressed as a likelihood curve for r, and yields an upper limit r_{0.05}<0.12 at 95% confidence. Marginalizing over dust and r, lensing B modes are detected at 7.0$\sigma$ significance.},

@article{Teng2011,
abstract = {The delensing procedure is an effective tool for removing lensing-induced $B$-mode polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background to allow for deep searches of primordial $B$-modes. However, the delensing algorithm existing in the literature breaks down if the target $B$-mode signals overlap significantly with the lensing $B$-mode ($\sim 300<l<2000$) in multipole-$l$ space. In this paper, we identify the cause of the breakdown to be correlations between the input $B$-map and the deflection field estimator ($EB$). The amplitude of this bias is quantified by numerical simulations and compared to the analytically derived functional form. We also propose a revised delensing procedure that circumvents the bias. While the newly identified bias does not affect the search of degree scale $B$-mode generated by tensor perturbations, the modified delensing algorithm makes it possible to perform deep searches of high-$l$ $B$-modes such as those generated by patchy reionization, cosmic strings, or rotation of polarization angles. Finally, we estimate how well future polarization experiments can do in detecting tensor- and cosmic string- generated $B$-mode after delensing and comment on different survey strategies.},

abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing by the intervening large-scale structure of the Universe induces high-order correlations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fields. We construct minimum variance estimators of the intervening mass distribution out of the six quadratic combinations of the temperature and polarization fields. Polarization begins to assist in the reconstruction when E-mode mapping becomes possible on degree-scale fields, i.e. for an experiment with a noise level of $\sim$40 uK-arcmin and beam of $\sim$7', similar to the Planck experiment; surpasses the temperature reconstruction at $\sim$26 uK-arcmin and 4'; yet continues to improve the reconstruction until the lensing B-modes are mapped to l $\sim$ 2000 at $\sim$0.3 uK-arcmin and 3'. Ultimately, the correlation between the E and B modes can provide a high signal-to-noise mass map out to multipoles of L $\sim$ 1000, extending the range of temperature-based estimators by nearly an order of magnitude. We outline four applications of mass reconstruction: measurement of the linear power spectrum in projection to the cosmic variance limit out to L $\sim$ 1000 (or wavenumbers 0.002 < k < 0.2 in h/Mpc), cross-correlation with cosmic shear surveys to probe the evolution of structure tomographically, cross-correlation of the mass and temperature maps to probe the dark energy, and the separation of lensing and gravitational wave B-modes.},

abstract = {This is a review of particle-theory models of inflation, and of their predictions for the primordial density perturbation that is thought to be the origin of structure in the Universe. It contains mini-reviews of the relevant observational cosmology, of elementary field theory and of supersymmetry, that may be of interest in their own right. The spectral index n(k), specifying the scale dependence of the spectrum of the curvature perturbation, will be a powerful discriminator between models, when it is measured by Planck with accuracy $\Delta$n∼0.01. The usual formula for n is derived, as well as its less familiar extension to the case of a multi-component inflaton; in both cases the key ingredient is the separate evolution of causally disconnected regions of the Universe. Primordial gravitational waves will be an even more powerful discriminator if they are observed, since most models of inflation predict that they are completely negligible. We treat in detail the new wave of models, which are firmly rooted in modern particle theory and have supersymmetry as a crucial ingredient. The review is addressed to both astrophysicists and particle physicists, and each section is fairly homogeneous regarding the assumed background knowledge.},

abstract = {The characterization of the Galactic foregrounds has been shown to be the main obstacle in the challenging quest to detect primordial B-modes in the polarized microwave sky. We make use of the Planck-HFI 2015 data release at high frequencies to place new constraints on the properties of the polarized thermal dust emission at high Galactic latitudes. Here, we specifically study the spatial variability of the dust polarized spectral energy distribution, and its potential impact on the determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We use the correlation ratio of the $C_\ell^{BB}$ angular power spectra between the 217- and 353-GHz channels as a tracer of these potential variations, computed on different high Galactic latitude regions, ranging from 80% to 20% of the sky. The new insight from Planck data is a departure of the correlation ratio from unity that cannot be attributed to a spurious decorrelation due to the cosmic microwave background, instrumental noise, or instrumental systematics. The effect is marginally detected on each region, but the statistical combination of all the regions gives more than 99% confidence for this variation in polarized dust properties. In addition, we show that the decorrelation increases when there is a decrease in the mean column density of the region of the sky being considered, and we propose a simple power-law empirical model for this dependence, which matches what is seen in the Planck data. We explore the effect that this measured decorrelation has on simulations of the BICEP2-Keck Array/Planck analysis and show that the 2015 constraints from those data still allow a decorrelation between the dust at 150 and 353GHz of the order of the one we measure. Finally we show that either spatial variation of the dust SED or of the dust polarization angle could produce decorrelations between 217- and 353-GHz data similar to those we observe in the data.},

@article{Seljak1997a,
abstract = {Polarization induced by cosmological scalar perturbations leads to a typical anisotropy pattern, which can best be analyzed in a Fourier domain. This allows one to distinguish a cosmological signal of polarization unambiguously from other foregrounds and systematics, as well as from polarization induced by nonscalar perturbations. The precision with which polarization and cross-correlation power spectra can be determined is limited by cosmic variance, noise, and foreground residuals. The choice of estimator can significantly improve our capability of extracting a cosmological signal, and in the noise-dominated limit the optimal power spectrum estimator reduces the variance by a factor of 2 compared to the simplest estimator. If foreground residuals are important, then a different estimator can be used, which eliminates systematic effects from foregrounds so that no further foreground subtraction is needed. A particular combination of Stokes Q and U parameters vanishes for scalar-induced polarization, thereby allowing a direct determination of tensor modes. Theoretical predictions of polarization in standard models show that one typically expects a signal at the level of 5-10 $\mu$K on small angular scales and around 1 $\mu$K on large scales (l < 200). Satellite missions should be able to reach sensitivities needed for an unambiguous detection of polarization, which would help to break the degeneracies in the determination of some of the cosmological parameters.},

On large angular scales the B-mode polarization of the CMB carries the imprint of primordial gravitational waves, and its precise measurement would provide a powerful probe of the epoch of inflation. The goal of LiteBIRD is to achieve a measurement of the characterizing tensor to scalar ratio $r$ to an uncertainty of $\delta r=0.001$. In order to achieve this goal we will employ a kilo-pixel superconducting detector array on a cryogenically cooled sub-Kelvin focal plane with an optical system at a temperature of 4$\sim$K. We are currently considering two detector array options; transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers and microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKID). In this paper we give an overview of LiteBIRD and describe a TES-based polarimeter designed to achieve the target sensitivity of 2$\sim$$\mu$K$\cdot$arcmin over the frequency range 50 to 320$\sim$GHz.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) gravitational lensing potential using data from the first two seasons of observations with SPTpol, the polarization-sensitive receiver currently installed on the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The observations used in this work cover 100 deg$^2$ of sky with arcminute resolution at 150 GHz. Using a quadratic estimator, we make maps of the CMB lensing potential from combinations of CMB temperature and polarization maps. We combine these lensing potential maps to form a minimum-variance (MV) map. The lensing potential is measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than one for angular multipoles between $100< L <250$. This is the highest signal-to-noise mass map made from the CMB to date and will be powerful in cross-correlation with other tracers of large-scale structure. We calculate the power spectrum of the lensing potential for each estimator, and we report the value of the MV power spectrum between $100< L <2000$ as our primary result. We constrain the ratio of the spectrum to a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model to be $A_{\rm MV}=0.92 \pm 0.14 {\rm\, (Stat.)} \pm 0.08 {\rm\, (Sys.)}$. Restricting ourselves to polarized data only, we find $A_{\rm POL}=0.92 \pm 0.24 {\rm\, (Stat.)} \pm 0.11 {\rm\, (Sys.)}$. This measurement rejects the hypothesis of no lensing at $5.9 \sigma$ using polarization data alone, and at $14 \sigma$ using both temperature and polarization data.},

abstract = {We present the implications for cosmic inflation of the Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies in both temperature and polarization based on the full Planck survey. The Planck full mission temperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angular scales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be $n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to $d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the Planck lensing likelihood. When the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results are consistent and uncertainties are reduced. The upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} < 0.11$ (95% CL), consistent with the B-mode polarization constraint $r< 0.12$ (95% CL) obtained from a joint BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck analysis. These results imply that $V(\phi) \propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to models predicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $R^2$ inflation. Three independent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum are investigated. The Planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordial perturbations. We investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropic modulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalized models of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kinetic term. The 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on the nominal mission data.},

abstract = {We reexamine the production of gravitational waves by bubble collisions during a first-order phase transition. The spectrum of the gravitational radiation is determined by numerical simulations using the "envelope approximation". We find that the spectrum rises as f^3.0 for small frequencies and decreases as f^-1.0 for high frequencies. Thus, the fall-off at high frequencies is significantly slower than previously stated in the literature. This result has direct impact on detection prospects for gravity waves originating from a strong first-order electroweak phase transition at space-based interferometers, such as LISA or BBO. In addition, we observe a slight dependence of the peak frequency on the bubble wall velocity.},

In this paper, we list the requirements for a future CMB polarisation survey addressing these scientific objectives, and discuss the design drivers of the CORE space mission proposed to ESA in answer to the "M5" call for a medium-sized mission. The rationale and options, and the methodologies used to assess the mission's performance, are of interest to other future CMB mission design studies. CORE is designed as a near-ultimate CMB polarisation mission which, for optimal complementarity with ground-based observations, will perform the observations that are known to be essential to CMB polarisation scienceand cannot be obtained by any other means than a dedicated space mission.},

abstract = {We derive a general ansatz for optimizing pseudo-Cℓ estimators used to measure cosmic microwave background anisotropy power spectra, and apply it to the recently proposed pure pseudo-Cℓ formalism, to obtain an estimator which achieves near-optimal B-mode power spectrum errors for any specified noise distribution while minimizing leakage from ambiguous modes. Our technique should be relevant for upcoming cosmic microwave background polarization experiments searching for B-mode polarization. We compare our technique both to the theoretical limits based on a full Fisher matrix calculation and to the standard pseudo-Cℓ technique. We demonstrate it by applying it to a fiducial survey with realistic inhomogeneous noise, complex boundaries, point source masking, and a noise level comparable to what is expected for next-generation experiments (˜5.75$\mu$K-arcmin). For such an experiment our technique could improve the constraints on the amplitude of a gravity wave background by over a factor of 10 compared to what could be obtained using ordinary pseudo-Cℓ, coming quite close to saturating the theoretical limit. Constraints on the amplitude of the lensing B-modes are improved by about a factor of 3.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of errors on the tensor-to-scalar ratio due to residual diffuse foregrounds, using simulated observations of a future CMB polarization satellite, modelled on the specification of ESA's CORE mission. We construct a full pipeline from microwave sky maps to $r$ likelihood, using two models of diffuse Galactic foregrounds with different complexity, and assuming component separation with varying degrees of accuracy. Our pipeline uses a linear mixture (Generalised Least Squares) solution for component separation, and a hybrid approach for power spectrum estimation, with a Quadratic Maximum Likelihood estimator at low $\ell$s and a pseudo-$C_{\ell}$ deconvolution at high $\ell$s. In the likelihood for $r$, we explore modelling foreground residuals as nuisance parameters. We find that $r=0.01$ can be measured successfully even for a complex sky model and in the presence of mismodelling of foregrounds spectral properties. However, the detection of $r=0.001$ is a lot more difficult, as inaccurate modelling of the foreground spectral properties results in a biased measurement of $r$. Once biases are eliminated, the total error on $r$ allows setting an upper limit rather than a detection, unless the uncertainties on the foreground spectral indices are very small ($\lesssim 1\%$ and $\lesssim 0.6\%$ for the synchrotron and dust spectral indices, respectively).},

@article{Sherwin2015,
abstract = {As confusion with lensing B modes begins to limit experiments that search for primordial B-mode polarization, robust methods for delensing the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization sky are becoming increasingly important. We investigate in detail the possibility of delensing the CMB with the cosmic infrared background (CIB), emission from dusty star-forming galaxies that is an excellent tracer of the CMB lensing signal, in order to improve constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r . We find that the maps of the CIB, such as current Planck satellite maps at 545 GHz, can be used to remove more than half of the lensing B-mode power. Calculating optimal combinations of different large-scale-structure tracers for delensing, we find that coadding CIB data and external arcminute-resolution CMB lensing reconstruction can lead to significant additional improvements in delensing performance. We investigate whether measurement uncertainty in the CIB power spectra will degrade the delensing performance if no model of the CIB spectra is assumed, and instead the CIB power spectra are marginalized over, when constraining r . We find that such uncertainty does not significantly affect B-mode surveys smaller than a few thousand degrees. Even for larger surveys it causes only a moderate reduction in CIB delensing performance, especially if the surveys have high (arcminute) resolution, which allows self calibration of the delensing procedure. Though further work on the impact of foreground residuals is required, our overall conclusions for delensing with current CIB data are optimistic: this delensing method can tighten constraints on r by a factor up to ≈2.2 , and by a factor up to ≈4 when combined with external lensing reconstruction for ≈3 $\mu$ K -arcmin noise, without requiring the modeling of CIB properties. CIB delensing is thus a promising method for the upcoming generation of CMB polarization surveys.},

abstract = {This paper presents the Planck 2015 likelihoods, statistical descriptions of the 2-point correlation functions of CMB temperature and polarization. They use the hybrid approach employed previously: pixel-based at low multipoles, $\ell$, and a Gaussian approximation to the distribution of cross-power spectra at higher $\ell$. The main improvements are the use of more and better processed data and of Planck polarization data, and more detailed foreground and instrumental models. More than doubling the data allows further checks and enhanced immunity to systematics. Progress in foreground modelling enables a larger sky fraction, contributing to enhanced precision. Improvements in processing and instrumental models further reduce uncertainties. Extensive tests establish robustness and accuracy, from temperature, from polarization, and from their combination, and show that the {\Lambda}CDM model continues to offer a very good fit. We further validate the likelihood against specific extensions to this baseline, such as the effective number of neutrino species. For this first detailed analysis of Planck polarization, we concentrate at high $\ell$ on E modes. At low $\ell$ we use temperature at all Planck frequencies along with a subset of polarization. These data take advantage of Planck's wide frequency range to improve the separation of CMB and foregrounds. Within the baseline cosmology this requires a reionization optical depth $\tau=0.078\pm0.019$, significantly lower than without high-frequency data for explicit dust monitoring. At high $\ell$ we detect residual errors in E, typically at the {\mu}K$^2$ level; we thus recommend temperature alone as the high-$\ell$ baseline. Nevertheless, Planck high-$\ell$ polarization spectra are already good enough to allow a separate high-accuracy determination of the {\Lambda}CDM parameters, consistent with those established from temperature alone.},

abstract = {We present a new estimation method for mapping the gravitational lensing potential from observed CMB intensity and polarization fields. Our method uses Bayesian techniques to estimate the average curvature of the potential over small local regions. These local curvatures are then used to construct an estimate of a low pass filter of the gravitational potential. By utilizing Bayesian/likelihood methods one can easily overcome problems with missing and/or non-uniform pixels and problems with partial sky observations (E and B mode mixing, for example). Moreover, our methods are local in nature which allow us to easily model spatially varying beams and are highly parallelizable. We note that our estimates do not rely on the typical Taylor approximation which is used to construct estimates of the gravitational potential by Fourier coupling. We present our methodology with a flat sky simulation under nearly ideal experimental conditions with a noise level of 1 $\mu K$-arcmin for the temperature field, $\sqrt{2}$ $\mu K$-arcmin for the polarization fields, with an instrumental beam full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.25 arcmin.},
